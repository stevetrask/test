  description: AWS Storage Lens or your dedicated Technical Account Manager can identify MPU's in S3 buckets. Once you identity MPU's on specific buckets, you can configure a lifecycle rule for those S3 buckets to automatically abort 7-day old (or whatever time period you find appropriate) incomplete multipart uploads. I'd argue that lifecycle rules on S3 buckets should be the default, not the exception. A full description of the services and outline of this process can be found in the AWS blog post here.
