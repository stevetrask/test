# How to contribute
FinOps has become a required practice at many large organizations, but it's also a nascent discipline and constantly evolving with cloud. This means that its best practices and principles will change over time as practitioners learn new skills, make new discoveries, and find new ways to better operationalize cloud cost management.

The open source FinOps Framework documents these changes with contributions from FinOps practitioners. This could be adding a FinOps story to one of our projects, fixing a simple typo or helping add completely new content.

## How to submit changes to the FinOps Framework

If you see something that needs to be updated, augmented, or removed, we want to hear about it. This project is by the community and for the community and your voice matters.

There are multiple ways to submit changes:
* Submit an update via the website page using the button 'Make Suggestion' this automatically creates a GitHub issue
* Create an issue directly [via GitHub](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/framework/issues)
* Make a commit using the [GitHub GUI](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/framework) and submit it for review
* Reach out to the members and team in the [#framework](https://finopsfoundation.slack.com/archives/C01UANLEPDW) slack channel



## Review process

Changes to each respective section of this site will be reviewed during FinOps Foundation team meetings, or meetings with the [Technical Advisory Council.](https://www.finops.org/about/) During these council meetings, commits and Pull Requests can be reviewed and voted upon to be merged.

The FinOps Foundation team uses automation tools to rebuild the site multiple times a week to capture the latest changes or to make small updates to maintain the site.

## Review cycles and timing

The FinOps Foundation's core operating members maintain the organization as a business. Its technical components, however, must be reviewed and voted upon by a greater group of community members. These meetings are scheduled throughout the month and the timeliness of reviewing commits and changes will vary depending on when these meetings occur.

Issues and small changes like link fixes and typos might occur immediately, as those don't require a significant amount of code review, voting, and/or approval.
