The cloud has fundamentally changed the way businesses approach IT development and operations. Now empowered with resource procurement, engineering teams spend more than needed without understanding cost efficiency. Surrounded by hundreds of new cost drivers, finance teams can’t keep up with what teams are spending. All the while, leadership struggles to decode company spending they have little to no input into.


FinOps changes that. Using the FinOps cloud operating model, your finance, engineering and leadership teams will come together to find the perfect balance of speed, cost and quality to efficiently scale their cloud.

Compiled from hands-on experience and real-life stories from FinOps practitioners, Cloud FinOps is your guide to operating a better cloud


> “We’ve heard the demand — the need — to formally define FinOps and to capture what makes the great FinOps practitioners successful. And that’s what you hold in this book.”
